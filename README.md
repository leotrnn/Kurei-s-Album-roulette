# Project on hold

Why you may ask ? because neither deezer or spotify could make a good enough api to get all artists by genres, which makes the random album completely off target (no artists returned for sub genres like nu metal or alt rock / getting f***ing Red Hot Chili Peppers when searching for metal lmao)

so yeah, until spotify makes improvements, project on hold
